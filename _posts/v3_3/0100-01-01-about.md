The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) is a unique collaborative venture between human rights practitioners, researchers, academics, and other human rights supporters.

===text-section
Our goal is to produce the first comprehensive set of measurements for tracking the human rights performance of countries.

Our 2020 data set includes:
* Annual data on five economic and social rights for 197 countries (depending on the right) from 2007 to 2017, based on the award-winning <a href="https://serfindex.uconn.edu/" target="_blank">SERF Index</a> methodology.
* Annual data on eight civil and political rights for 33 countries for the years 2018 - 2019, or 2017 - 2019 (depending on the country), with more countries added each year.

Over time we aim to extend our civil and political rights data to the rest of the world, and expand our work to measure more human rights.
