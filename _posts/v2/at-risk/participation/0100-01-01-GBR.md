When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their political participation by the government or its agents in 2018, our respondents mentioned all of the following:
-	Limitations in the number of voices allowed by the mass media
-	Overspending and other (sometimes criminal) rule-breaking in the context of referenda and elections
-	People in prison who are not allowed to vote
-	People with mental health disabilities
