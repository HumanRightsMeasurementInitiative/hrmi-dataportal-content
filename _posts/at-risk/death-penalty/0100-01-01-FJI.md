When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to death penalty executions by government agents in 2018, our respondents mentioned all of the following:
-	Even though the death penalty is not legal in Fiji, some fear that Fiji might see a re-introduction of the death penalty in the near future. If that occurs, there is fear that some people would be particularly at risk, as described below.
-	Indigenous Fijians will be targeted due to disagreement with new policies
-	Journalists and the media
-	Non-government organisations
-	Religious bodies
