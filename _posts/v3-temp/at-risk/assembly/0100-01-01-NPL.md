When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their rights to assembly and association by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:
-	The government has attempted to declare many public areas as restricted space where people cannot protest. Many protests end in confrontation with police
-	The government’s proposed National Integrity Policy would limit assembly and association 
-	Protesters, especially those who protest government actions
-	Human rights and civil rights groups protesting the government’s policy corruption and inaction for specific crime , like the Nirmala Panta rape and murder case
