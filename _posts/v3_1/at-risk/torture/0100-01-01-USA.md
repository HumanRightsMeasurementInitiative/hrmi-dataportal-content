When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to torture and ill-treatment by government agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

- People of certain races, particularly black and Latinx people, who are also incarcerated at a disproportional rate and face more torture and ill treatment compared to their white counterparts 
- Young men of color were particularly at risk, 
- Refugees and asylum seekers, particularly those from Central America, who were indefinitely detained and separated from their families, 
- Immigrants, particularly those from Central America, and especially those who are undocumented, 
- Detainees or people accused of crimes, who faced solitary confinement, physical torture, and sexual abuse; particularly in the South and Southwest US 
- Homeless people,  
- Dissidents and activists, including racial activists, environmental activists, and land activists, 
- Those suspected of terrorism, especially those who are Islamic or of a pan-Arabic ethnicity
