For every new country, make copies of this file for every metric and language, and update the file name (replacing ZZZ with the country code) and file metadata accordingly. Specifically

* permalink
  * update language code (one of [en/es/fr/pt])
  * update metric code (same as folder name - ultimately must be consistent with ["key" used in application)[https://github.com/HumanRightsMeasurementInitiative/hrmi-dataportal/blob/master/app/containers/App/constants.js#L446])
  * update country code (replace ZZZ with 3 letter country code)
  * note: it is important to keep the initial and trailing '/'
* lang
  * update language code (one of [en/es/fr/pt])
