When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have food that meets the requirements of the right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:
- People of low social or economic status,  
- People of certain races, ethnicities, and nationalities, including Yemenis thanks to Saudi destruction of food,  
- Detainees or persons suspected of crimes, with inmates at risk for low quality food or food incongruent with medical conditions,
