When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have food that meets the requirements of the right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:
- Homeless people in major cities, particularly children  
- People with disabilities 
- Those of low social or economic status  
- Elderly persons  
- Women and girls, who are considered last  
- Detainees, or those accused of crimes, many of whom are provided the same meals of rice and tinned fish, despite courts ordering PNG Corrections to provide a more varied diet  
- People living in urban areas
- People living in rural areas, particularly those in forested regions where logging and palm oil extraction prevents traditional food sources (Sepik and New Britain), and those living where mine waste has damaged fish stocks (Madang and the Fly river) 
- LGBTQIA+ persons, who might be ordered off their lands
