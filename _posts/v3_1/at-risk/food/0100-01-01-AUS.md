When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following: 
 
- People with low social or economic status, particularly those in poverty, and homeless persons
- Unemployed persons, particularly those on benefits as these benefits aren’t enough to live off of 
- People on said benefits are forced onto a “cashless card” – which limits what individuals can buy and where they can buy it 
- Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders)
- Asylum seekers and refugees, who suffer from removals of income and casework support 
- In particular, vulnerable subsets of asylum seekers and refugees, like families with children, elderly people, and pregnant women are unable to meet basic nutrition needs 
- People with disabilities 
- Many people are forced to rely on charity
