When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	Lack of access to food stems from the lack of access to employment, and all people are at risk
-	Lack of access to food further stems from systemic income inequality and cuts to programmes meant to address income inequality, leaving low income persons at risk
-	People of low social or economic status, especially homeless people and those living in slums
-	Indigenous people
-	Those in certain geographic areas or regions, including North, South, Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast regions
-	Those in the Northeast region were particularly at risk, thanks to social programme cuts by the Federal government
-	People living in rural or peripheral regions, particularly farmers, who are increasingly at risk thanks to Brazil’s government moving peasant farming investments to large-scale agribusiness, with programmes like PNAE and PAA being cut
-	People of particular races, especially black people and Quilombolas 
-	Detainees or those accused of crimes, including formerly detained persons
-	Immigrants, including those working informally
-	Young people, particularly those with low levels of education
-	Domestic workers, including those working informally 
-	People with disabilities, including mental health problems
-	Those with addictions, including illicit drugs and alcoholism
-	Elderly persons 
-	People of certain religious or cultural beliefs, including those practising African religions
-	LGBTQIA+ people 
-	Women and girls
-	Victims of state violence/drug trafficking and their families
-	People affected by dams
-	Cutting of government programmes limits the right to food under the goal of a “minimal state”
