When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

-	Guam imports most of its food, resulting in a lack of food security
-	Immigrants, particularly those from the Freely Associated States
-	Indigenous people, particularly Chamorros who have lost farmlands to US military seizures, leaving them dependent on social programs
