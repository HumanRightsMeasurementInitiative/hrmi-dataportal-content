When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Those of low social or economic status, particularly the poor, and poor persons who are not impoverished enough to reach the poverty line 
- Immigrants and refugees  
- People in certain geographic areas, especially those in southern governorates, who can go days without food and rely on charity; those in villages and districts outside of the capital, those in poor capital neighborhoods, and remote areas of the capital where employment is low
