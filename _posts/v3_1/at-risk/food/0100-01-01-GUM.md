When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Guam imports most of its food, resulting in a lack of food security 
- People of low social or economic status  
- Homeless people 
- Immigrants, particularly those from the Freely Associated States  
- Indigenous people, particularly Chamorros who have lost farmlands to US military seizures, leaving them dependent on social programs
