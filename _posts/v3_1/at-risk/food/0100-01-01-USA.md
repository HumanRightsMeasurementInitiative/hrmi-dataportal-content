When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have food that meets the requirements of the right to food in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

-	People of low social or economic status, particular poor people of colour, who suffered from cuts to food stamp programs
-	People living in impoverished communities, who are unable to buy quality, fresh, nutritious food (they live in ‘food deserts’)
-	Indigenous people, particularly those reliant on agriculture
-	People living in certain rural areas
-	People of certain races, specifically racial minorities
-	Transgender people
