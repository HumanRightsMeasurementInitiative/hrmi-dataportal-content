When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to work in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders), who are impacted by lack of available jobs, and discrimination/institutional barriers in the workplace 
- Refugees and asylum seekers, who are prevented from working 
- People with disabilities 
- People in remote areas, who donâ€™t have sufficient work opportunities
- Low skilled job opportunities are particularly scarce 
- Immigrants, particularly those on temporary visas 
- Women, thanks to a significant wage gap 
- Increased instances of casual employment mean less stable and secure income situations 
- Young people 
- Elderly persons
