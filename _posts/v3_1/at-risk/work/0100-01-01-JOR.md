When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to work in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- There is no universal right to work  
- Refugees, particularly those who are unregistered  
- Women and/or girls  
- Gazans  
- Those with educations, thanks to oversaturation of certain degrees
