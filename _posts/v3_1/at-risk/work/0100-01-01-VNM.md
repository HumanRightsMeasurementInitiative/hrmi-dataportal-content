When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have work that meets the requirements of the right to work in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following: 

-	Those working in labour-intensive industries
-	Trade unions are not allowed to form
-	People of ethnic minorities, like the Montagnard and Hmong peoples
-	People in certain geographic areas, including rural areas, especially indigenous people, which forces migration to large urban centres
-	Christians
-	Jobs are often low paying, unstable, and come without benefits
