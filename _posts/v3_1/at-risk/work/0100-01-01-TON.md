When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have work that meets the requirements of the right to work in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

- People with disabilities
- Those with lower levels of education
- People with low social or economic status, particularly those with low incomes
- Women can be denied positions if men are also in contention for jobs, earn less than men, and also remain unpaid for work considered “domestic” 
- Internal migrants
