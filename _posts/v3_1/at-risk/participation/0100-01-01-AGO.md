- Journalists, especially those with tenure or seniority
- Dissidents and activists, especially those associated with civil society, revolutionary, and/or student movements
- NGOs associated with the ruling party have status enabling access to public funds, while NGOs working on issues like human rights are discriminated against
- People of low social or economic status, including anyone not part of the ruling party
- Ordinary citizens lack the right to participate in political life 
- Access to political leaders is stifled and the right to vote is suppressed
- People associated with opposition parties, including UNITA, Pra-ja, and PRS
