When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their political participation by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	People of certain races, particularly African American or Latinx people, were subject to disenfranchisement in conservative states
-	Immigrants, particularly those who are not white
-	People of low social or economic status, who were systematically disenfranchised in conservative states
-	Voter identification laws disproportionately impacted poor people or people of colour
-	Detainees or those accused of crimes, particularly formerly jailed persons despite completing their sentences
-	LGBTQIA+ persons
-	States relied on voter suppression tactics like gerrymandering, limiting polling places and hours, limiting absentee balloting, enacting voter identification laws, disallowing registration, and purging ‘inactive’ voters
