When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their political participation by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Homeless people 
- Those living in rural areas 
- People with disabilities, particularly blind and deaf people
- Asylum seekers and refugees, who continue to be held in offshore detention centers 
- Those entitled to citizenships of other countries 
- Certain types of organizations, like charities or social organizations
- Trade unions 
- People with certain political beliefs or associations, particularly opposition 
- Discussions about banning boycotts (or other activities meant to encourage positive corporate behavior with regards to environment and human rights) have the potential to limit political participation
