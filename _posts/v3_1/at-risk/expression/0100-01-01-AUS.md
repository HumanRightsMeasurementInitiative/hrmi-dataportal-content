When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their rights to opinion and expression by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following: 
 
- Journalists, particularly those reporting on human rights, immigration, or whistle blowers; who can have homes and offices raided 
- Media networks who also report on the issues, such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, who had their headquarters raided 
- People with certain political beliefs or associations, including those critical of the government
- People of certain races or ethnicities, particularly ethnic minorities, who are encouraged to self-censor 
- Excessive police presence at certain protests, like the Extinction rebellion, tempered the right to free opinion and expression
