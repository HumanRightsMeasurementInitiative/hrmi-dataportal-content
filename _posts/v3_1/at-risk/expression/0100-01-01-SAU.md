-	Journalists, especially opinion writers
-	Academics, particularly those who are heavily engaged in research
-	People with certain political affiliations, such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Pan Arabists
-	No one is allowed to openly express their opinion if it is critical of the government or goes against its official messaging
