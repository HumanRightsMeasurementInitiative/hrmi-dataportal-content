When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to death penalty killing by government agents in 2018, our respondents mentioned all of the following:
-	While the death penalty is banned in Australia, Australian officials cooperate with officials of other countries where the death penalty is available, and it is not illegal to share information with other countries that may use that information to impose the death penalty.
-	Asylum seekers and refugees are sometimes encouraged to return to countries where they could be sentenced to death.
