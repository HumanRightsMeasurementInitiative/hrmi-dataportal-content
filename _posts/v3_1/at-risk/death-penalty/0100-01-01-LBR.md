When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to death penalty killing by government agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following: 
 
- Liberia has not repealed the death penalty, but the state has not carried out executions since 2005
- According to other sources, it is abolitionist in practice. However, the state after signing and acceding to the SOP of the ICCPR in 2005, but it reintroduced the death penalty in 2008 (Source: [Africa Online](https://frontpageafricaonline.com/news/cso-condemns-liberias-reintroduction-of-death-penalty-in-shadow-report/). Despite this, Amnesty International reports that they have not carried out any executions in over 10 years (Source: [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/)))
