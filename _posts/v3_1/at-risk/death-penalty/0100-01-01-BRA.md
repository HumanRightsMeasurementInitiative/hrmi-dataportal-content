When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to death penalty killing by government agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	There is no death penalty
-	Despite this, black people, young people, teenagers, indigenous people, and LGBTQIA+ persons are at risk. People are killed on the streets because of police activity, even if they havenâ€™t committed any crime
