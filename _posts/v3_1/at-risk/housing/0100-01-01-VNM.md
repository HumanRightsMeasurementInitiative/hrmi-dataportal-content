When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have housing that meets the requirements of the right to housing in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following: 

-	The cost of housing is too high for many groups
-	There are no unilateral housing assistance programs
-	Christians
-	People of ethnic minorities, like the Montagnard and Hmong peoples
-	Confiscation of land without compensation leaves victims homeless. These victims are called ‘Dan oan’
