When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have housing that meets the requirements of the right to housing in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

-	Homelessness is exacerbated by poor social housing programs
-	People of certain races, specifically racial minorities
-	Housing is highly segregated, with housing for wealthy or upper middle class families flourishing to the exclusion of all other groups
-	People living in urban areas, particularly poor people, and those living in cities with unaffordable housing
-	LGBTQIA+ persons, particularly young people
-	Detainees and former detainees, who live in dilapidated prisons and are barred from some housing options after release
