- People with low social or economic status 
- Indigenous people, particularly Chamorros who have lost their lands to military seizures 
- Immigrants, particularly those from the Freely Associated States, and especially those from Micronesian Islands 
- People with disabilities, particularly those suffering from addiction 
- Military personnel renting homes on Guam have driven up the costs of housing
