When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to housing in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders), particularly those in remote communities
- Growing homeless populations, particularly older women 
- People of low social or economic status, particularly those reliant on welfare 
- Asylum seekers and refugees 
- People with disabilities, particularly those with mental illnesses 
- Those living in remote or rural areas 
- Women and girls, particularly victims of domestic violence, and older women 
- Migrants, particularly those without any support, and those on temporary visas 
- People living in urban areas, thanks to rising housing costs 
- Young people 
- LGBTQIA+ persons, especially youth 
- Removal of vital income and casework support for asylum seekers leaves many at risk
