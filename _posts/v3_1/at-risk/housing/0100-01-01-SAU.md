When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have housing that meets the requirements of the right to housing in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:
 
- Stateless persons and refugees, such as the Bidun people 
- Street Children/Homeless youth
- Those of low social or economic status  
- Women and/or girls, who are punished if absent from a guardianâ€™s home  
- Immigrants, particularly those with lower paying jobs
