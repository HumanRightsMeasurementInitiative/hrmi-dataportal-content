-	Indigenous peoples, particularly Pygmy people, who live in huts and are not provided modern housing
-	Refugees and internally displaced persons
-	People with certain diseases
-	Those in certain geographic regions or areas, particularly those living in the equatorial forest or marshes, and particularly the provinces of South Kivu, North Kivu, the Rutshuru territory, and Lubero, Beni, Masisi, Walikale, Nyiragongo, and Goma
