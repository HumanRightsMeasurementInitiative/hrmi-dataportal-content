When asked to provide more context about who was particularly vulnerable to restrictions on their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	Lack of documentation leaves individuals with lower social or economic status at risk
-	There are nationwide problems with the right to education
-	Many children arenâ€™t in school due to costs of education, with universities experiencing similar problems
-	Victims of forced eviction are particularly at risk, especially in Luanda where children have not been to school in seven years
