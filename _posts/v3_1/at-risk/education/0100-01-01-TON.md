When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:
- People with Disabilities 
- People with low social or economic status, particularly low-income families, who can force children to leave school in order to work 
- Street children/homeless youth 
- Women and/or girls, whom risk expulsion if they become pregnant 
- Costs split between the Ministry and PTA can cause supply problems
