When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

-	Funding structures built from property taxes means wealthy communities have better funded education than impoverished communities
-	These funding structures also result in better resources in wealthy white communities than non-white communities
-	People of certain races, specifically racial minorities
-	People of low social or economic status, particularly the poor and homeless
-	Immigrants, particularly children from undocumented families
-	People with disabilities, particularly those who cannot access customised education plans like IEPs
