When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

- Funding structures built from property taxes means wealthy communities have better funded education than impoverished communities 
- These funding structures also result in better resources in wealthy white communities than non-white communities  
- People of certain races, particularly minorities  
- Indigenous people 
- Homeless people  
- People of low social or economic status, particularly the poor and homeless  
- Immigrants, particularly children from undocumented families  
- Asylum seekers and refugees  
- Detainees or those accused of crimes  
- People with disabilities, particularly those who cannot access customized education plans like IEPs 
- LGBTQIA+ persons
