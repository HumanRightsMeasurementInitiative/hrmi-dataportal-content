When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

- Any group unable to afford education 
- People with low social or economic status  
- People with disabilities  
- Homeless people, particularly young people 
- Women and girls, who can have education disrupted by pregnancy, or are forced out of education to support households through labor or housework
- Students, who were at risk for expulsion if they protested  
- LGBTQIA+ persons  
- People living in rural areas, particularly children
