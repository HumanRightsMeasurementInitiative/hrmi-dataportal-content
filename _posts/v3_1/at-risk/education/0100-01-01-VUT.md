When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

- All people were at significant risk  
- People in rural areas, where children must travel far distances to reach school 
- Additionally, some rural families decide against sending their children to school 
- People with disabilities, resulting from the lack of national sign language, braille
