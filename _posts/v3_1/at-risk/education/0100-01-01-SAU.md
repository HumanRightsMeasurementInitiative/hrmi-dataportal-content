When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have education that meets the requirements of the right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:
- Stateless persons and refugees, such as the Bidun people, and Syrian refugees 
- People of certain races, ethnicities, and nationalities, including Yemenis and other non-Saudis  
- People with certain religious or cultural beliefs, including Shiites
- Families of certain politicians or political prisoners  
- Women and/or girls, as educational inequality is a massive problem
