When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

-	Funding structures built from property taxes means wealthy communities have better funded education than impoverished communities
-	These funding structures also result in better resources in wealthy white communities than non-white communities
-	People of certain races, specifically racial minorities
-	People of low social or economic status, particularly the poor and homeless
-	Immigrants, particularly children from undocumented families
-	People with disabilities, particularly those who cannot access customised education plans like IEPs
