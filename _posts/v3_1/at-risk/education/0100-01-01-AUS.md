When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

-	Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders), who many times donâ€™t have access to education in their mother tongue, or access to education at all
-	Asylum seekers and refugees, particularly those without income support or those who are homeless
-	People living in remote areas
-	Immigrants, particularly children on temporary visas
-	The costs of primary, secondary, and university education limits the right to education
-	Those from poorer states or communities often have lower quality education than richer states and communities
