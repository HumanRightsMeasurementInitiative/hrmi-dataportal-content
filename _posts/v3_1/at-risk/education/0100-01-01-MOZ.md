When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	Those in areas struck by disaster, including those affected by war zones, cyclones, floods, and droughts
-	Those living in rural areas, particularly those in central and northern Mozambique, and Cabo Delgado
-	People with low social or economic status, especially homeless people
-	Girls, who are at risk of sexual abuse due to the ‘sex for grades’ practice
-	Schooling that is provided suffers from lacking supplies and unqualified teachers
