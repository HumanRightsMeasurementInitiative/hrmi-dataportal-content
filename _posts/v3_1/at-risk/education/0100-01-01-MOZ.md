When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Those in areas struck by disaster, including those affected by war zones, cyclones, floods, and droughts 
- Those living in rural areas, particularly those in central and northern Mozambique, and Cabo Delgado 
- Street children/homeless youth 
- People with low social or economic status, especially homeless people  
- The practice of “sex for grades” leaves girls at risk for sexual abuse 
- Schooling that is provided suffers from lacking supplies and unqualified teachers
