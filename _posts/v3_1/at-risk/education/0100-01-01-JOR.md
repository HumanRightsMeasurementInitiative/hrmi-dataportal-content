When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to education in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Refugees, particularly those who are unregistered  
- Anybody who doesnâ€™t have ID cards (immigrants, children of mothers married to non-Jordanians, refugees) 
- Those living in remote areas  
- Existing public education is not adequate  
- For non-Jordanians, education is particularly expensive 
- Those in certain geographic areas, particularly those in provincial or tribal areas like the Roma
