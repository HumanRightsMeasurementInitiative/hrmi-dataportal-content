When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	Everybody was at significant risk
-	Those of low social and economic status, especially the poor
-	Those in areas struck by disaster, including those affected by war zones, cyclones, floods, and droughts
-	Those living in rural areas, particularly those in central and northern Mozambique, and those in rural southern areas
-	Pregnant women, thanks to long distances between homes and health facilities
