When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have health that meets the requirements of the right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following: 

-	Detainees or those accused of crimes, as they are more vulnerable to illnesses due to concerns over torture, labour, and food
-	People of low social or economic status, due to high costs of healthcare
-	People of ethnic minorities, like the Montagnard and Hmong peoples
-	Christians
-	Any individuals not listed in the household registration group
