When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have health that meets the requirements of the right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

-	People living in certain geographic areas, such as Siesia Island and rural areas of Tongatapu
-	People with certain medical conditions, particularly those with mental health conditions 
-	Women, particularly those who come from religious/traditional families who do not permit women access to the use of medical treatment
