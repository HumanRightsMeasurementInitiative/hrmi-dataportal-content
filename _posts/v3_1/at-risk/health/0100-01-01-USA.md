-	High costs of health care left many without sufficient care, particularly those without health insurance
-	People of low social or economic status, particularly those unemployed
-	Only wealthy persons had access to quality health care
-	Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented
-	People of certain races, specifically racial minorities
-	People with disabilities, particularly those with mental illness
-	People with medical illnesses
-	Women and girls, who have difficulty getting reproductive and maternal care, including family planning, abortion, and contraception; and minority women who particularly experience these problems
-	Some laws limited specialised healthcare for women or LGBTQIA+ persons
-	People living in rural areas, who must travel long distances to reach health facilities
-	Refugees and asylum seekers, particularly those in detention
-	Detainees or those accused of crimes, particularly those in for-profit prisons
