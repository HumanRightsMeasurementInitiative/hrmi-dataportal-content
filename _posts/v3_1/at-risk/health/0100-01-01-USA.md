When asked to provide more context about which people, if any, were particularly unlikely to have health that meets the requirements of the right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned the following:

- High costs of health care left many without sufficient care, particularly those without health insurance
- Homeless people
- People of low social or economic status, particularly those unemployed 
- Only wealthy persons had access to quality health care  
- Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented  
- Indigenous people 
- People of certain races, specifically minorities 
- People with disabilities, particularly those with mental illness 
- People with medical illnesses 
- Women and girls, who have difficulty getting reproductive and maternal care, including family planning, abortion, and contraception; and minority women who particularly experience the aforementioned problems  
- Some laws limited specialized healthcare for women or LGBTQIA+ persons  
- People living in rural areas, who must travel long distances to reach health facilities 
- Refugees and asylum seekers, particularly those in detention 
- Detainees or those accused of crimes, particularly those in for-profit prisons
