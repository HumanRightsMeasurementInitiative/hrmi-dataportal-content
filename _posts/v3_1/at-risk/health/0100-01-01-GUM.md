When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following: 

- Everyone was at significant risk, thanks to widespread poverty and expensive health insurance
- A shortage of doctors also leaves everyone at significant risk  
- Those of low social or economic status 
- Immigrants from the Freely Associated States  
- Indigenous persons 
- Those living in south Guam, who have a long commute to the nearest hospital in case of emergencies 
- Government workers
