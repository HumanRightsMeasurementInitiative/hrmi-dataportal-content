When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Because there is no general health insurance many people are at risk of foregoing treatment or getting insufficient treatment
- Everybody was particularly at risk, as healthcare in Jordan is lacking in quality and availability  
- Existing hospitals are lacking in supplies, qualified medical personnel, and medical space
- Refugees, particularly those who are unregistered 
- Men and/or boys 
- Insufficient occupational, safety and health standards mean high levels of injury among certain industries
