When asked to provide more context about who was particularly unlikely to enjoy their right to health in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Indigenous people (Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders)
- Indigenous communities in particular have a higher incidence rate of kidney disease, while dialysis is primarily available in larger urban areas 
- Asylum seekers and refugees, particularly those living without income support or those that are homeless, and those in detention offshore, particularly when it comes to mental healthcare
- Mental healthcare is particularly unavailable for those without money  
- People living in remote areas 
- People of low social or economic status, particularly those in poverty 
- People with disabilities, particularly people with mental disabilities, are disproportionately represented in prisons, where they receive less than adequate healthcare 
- A religious discrimination bill threatens access to many types of treatment, including contraception, HIV treatment, abortion, hormone replacement therapy, and others
