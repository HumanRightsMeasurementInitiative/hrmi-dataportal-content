When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their rights to assembly and association by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

-	United Buddhist church adherents of Hoa Hao
-	Protestants (especially ethnic minorities from Central Highlands) 
-	Catholics
-	Religious organisations critical of the government or resistant to government control
-	Dissidents and activists, including human rights defenders like Brotherhood for Democracy
-	Those suspected of reading or spreading unapproved books
-	People of certain races or ethnicities, including the Montagnard people from the Northwest
-	Public gatherings, especially with prominent human rights figures, can be prevented if the government receives word beforehand
-	Legal limitations to indoor meetings and outdoor gatherings hindered this right
-	Lengthy requirements for assembly prevent many organisations from doing so successfully
