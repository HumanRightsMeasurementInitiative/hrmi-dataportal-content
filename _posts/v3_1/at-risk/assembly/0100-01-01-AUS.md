When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to restrictions on their rights to assembly and association by the government or its agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:  

- Dissidents and activists, particularly those critical of the government and attempting to organise protests, and those attempting to non-violently protest against certain business related to climate change 
- Climate change protests in particular, including Extinction Rebellion; in particular, those protesting a mining conference in October were subjected to arrest and physical violence, and others were arrested in October for protesting in Sydney. 
- Trade unions 
- LGBTQIA+ persons, thanks to government shutdown of programmes geared towards them
