When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to extrajudicial killing by government agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following: 

- Indigenous persons, particularly Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, who are killed without repercussions to police in many cases, and their rate of eath in custody remains disproportionately high 
- Children, particularly those in the Don Dale Detention Center 
- Asylum seekers and refugees 
- People with disabilities, particularly those with mental illnesses
