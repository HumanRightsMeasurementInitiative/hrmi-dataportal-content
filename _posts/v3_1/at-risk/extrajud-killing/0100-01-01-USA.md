When asked to provide more context about who was especially vulnerable to extrajudicial killing by government agents in 2019, our respondents mentioned all of the following:

- People of certain races, particularly black and latinx people killed by excessive police force, many of whom are young 
- Such killings happened with near total impunity  
- Men/boys, particularly racial minorities  
- People suspected of crimes  
- People living outside of the US â€“ drone strikes kill many people, particularly in the middle east
- People with disabilities
